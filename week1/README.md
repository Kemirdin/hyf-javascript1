Homework week 1:

Git homework

Git homework for this week:

Pair up with another student in your class. The homework requires two people to work together. Let us call them admin and user.

admin creates a new repository on github called “animals” (without quotes).
admin adds a file called “zoo.txt” with some animal generally found in a zoo.
admin commits and pushes his changes (in master branch)
admin adds user as a collaborator (find out how to add a collaborator to a git repository)
user clones a repository from admin (find out how to clone a repository. Note that git init is not required when you clone a repository)
user makes a new branch called user-dev
user adds another file called “pets.txt” with some animals generally found in a home.
user commits and pushes his branch to remote
admin pulls the branch crated by user (find out how to pull changes from the repository)
admin submits the link to his github repository (named animal), where unmesh should be able to see the collaborator’s (i.e. user’s) branch along with his commits.

I have done part user-dev with my colleague , this is link:
